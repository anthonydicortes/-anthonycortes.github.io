### Motivation

Since several years ago I've been thinking in create my own blog to share with the programmers community (not only [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)) several
of my achievements and how I solved several challenges I faced during my still short career (still in progress), and finally that day has come, enjoy and
I hope that some of those topic help to you to achieve yours goals. 

### Who I'm because I am how I am

I'm from a small city called Bucaramanga located in Colombia, surrounded by a lot of problems as same as the country, fortunately, lack of passion is not one of those, at least for me.

Quickly I realized that my life won't be easy, I wasn't charismatic, handsome, clever, rich, or talented, and most of the 
time very shy and my vision sucks (I still use glasses all the time), but that shyness saved me from my own destruction, 
while I used my frustration and people's contempt as motivation to do my best quietly, others used their qualities and free 
time to get quick satisfaction no matter their future. I knew from the beginning that my time will come, and you'll realize why I say it.

Since I was a child the computer was my escape from the nightmare that was my real life (children can be very aggressive with 
others sometimes), even sometimes nowadays, to be honest, but my life is not that horrible now, and yes, before you asking 
about my studies, I finally achieved my title as a software engineer after endless nights without sleep, and I have to confess 
something, I lost my Java programming class. I'm a software engineer (Thanks to public university [Universidad Industrial de Santander](https://uis.edu.co) 
and millions of Colombian taxpayers and friends that studied with me during long hours) and , and have financial stability (Thanks 
to _Robert Kiyosaki_ and his bestseller [Rich Dad Poor Dad](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69571.Rich_Dad_Poor_Dad)), love still seems far away, and even more so for someone 
who grew up between numbers and lines of code, for whom social interactions seem fake most of the time and too complex 
(Too much drama, and me, I'm looking for happiness, not perfection, at least not outside of my job.), but I still have 
the hope that having enough money it will be a matter of time before a nice woman notices me and not just for help, favors, or only money.
