### Motivation

Since several years ago I've been thinking in create my own blog to share with the programmers community (not only [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)) several
of my achievements and how I solved several challenges I faced during my still short career (still in progress), and finally that day has come, enjoy and
I hope that some of those topic help to you to achieve yours goals. 

### Who I'm because I am how I am

I'm from a small city called Bucaramanga located in Colombia, surrounded by a lot of problems as same as the country, fortunately, lack of passion is not one of those, at least for me.

Quickly I realized that my life won't be easy, I wasn't charismatic, handsome, clever, easygoing, and most of the time very shy and my vision sucks,
but that shyness save me from my own destruction, you'll realize why I say it.

since I was a child the computer was my escape from the nightmare that was my real life (children can be very aggressive with others sometimes), even sometimes nowadays, to be honest, but my life is not that horrible now that I'm a software engineer (Thanks to public university [Universidad Industrial de Santander](https://uis.edu.co) and millions of Colombian taxpayers) and have financial stability (Thanks to _Robert Kiyosaki_ and his bestseller [Rich Dad Poor Dad](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69571.Rich_Dad_Poor_Dad)),
love still seems far away, and even more so for someone who grew up between numbers and lines of code, for whom social interactions seem fake most of the time and too complex, but I still have the hope that having enough money it will be a matter of
time before a nice woman notices me and not just for help, favors, or only money.
